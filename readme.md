F20GA: 3D Graphics and Animation

This course involved an introduction into computer graphics: matrices, cameras, lighting techniques, shaders, transformations, etc.

The coursework project involved three components:
- Create a 3D model with multiple components and render it (ideally using Maya & Arnold but Blender and others were allowed)
- Export a animation using Unreal
- **This repo:** Develop an *interactive component visualisation* using a C++ and a graphics API (we used OpenGL)

The `source.cpp` and shaders were provided as basic templates at the beginning of the course, and we had to add significantly to them to produce the final product. 

**RE: Model loading:** I should definitely have used instancing.
